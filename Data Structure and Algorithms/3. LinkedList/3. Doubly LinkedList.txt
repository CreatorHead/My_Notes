Doubly Linked List
==================

* The advantage of doubly linked list (also called two-way linked list) is that given node in a list, we can navigate in both directions.

* The disadvantages of doubly linked lists are:
	a. Each node requires an extra pointer, requiring more space.
	b. The insertion or deletion of a node takes a bit longer.
