Insertion Sort
	> Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient comparision sort.
	> In this algorithm each iteration removes an element 
	  from the input data and inserts it into the correct position in the list being sorted.

	Advantages:
		> Simple implementation
		> Efficient for small data
		> Practically more efficient than bubble sort
		> In-Place: It requires only a constant amount of additional memory space.
