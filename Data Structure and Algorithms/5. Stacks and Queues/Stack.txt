Stack
=====
* A Stack is a simple data structure for storing 
	(similar to LinkedList).

* A stack is an ordered list in which insertion and
	deletion are done at one end, called as top.
	The last element inserted is the first one to
	be deleted. 

* Hence, it is called Last in First out (LIFO)
	or First in Last Out(FILO) list.

* When an element is inserted in a stack,
	the concept is called as push, and when 
	an element is
	removed from the stack, the concept is called as pop.

* Trying to pop out an empty stack is called
	Underflow and trying to push an element in
	a full stack is called as Overflow. Generally,
	we treat then as exceptions.

	
	
Main Stack Operations
======================
* push(int data): Inserts data onto stack
* pop(): Removes and returns the last inserted
	element from the stack.
* peek(): It will return the top element of the
	stack without popping
* isEmpty(): Indicates wheter any elements are 
	stored in stack or not.
* isFull(): Indicates whether the stack is full. 
	returns true if the stack is full.


Applicatoin of Stacks
=====================
* Balancing of symbols
* Implementing function calls(including recursion)
* Undo sequence in a text-editor
* Matching the Tags in HTML and XML
