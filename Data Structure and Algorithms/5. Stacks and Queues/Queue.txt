Queue
=====
* A queue is a data structure used for storing data
 (similar to LinkedLists and Stacks).
* A queue is an ordered list in which insertion 
	are done at one end and deletions are done at
	other end(front).
* The first element to be inserted is the first one 
	to be deleted . Hence, it is called First in 
	First Out(FIFO) or Last in Last Out(LILO) list.
* When an element is inserted in a queue, the 
	concept is called EnQueue, and When an element
	is removed from the queue,the concept is called 
	as DeQueue.
* DeQueueing an empty queue is called underflow and 
	EnQueuing an element in a full queue is called
	overflow.
	
	

Operations on Queue
===================
* enQueue(int data): Inserts an element at the end 
	of the queue.
* deQueue(): Removes and returns the elements at 
	the front of the queue.
