ArrayList
=========

* ArrayList are also called as growable array, 
	resizable array, dynamic array

* ArrayList is a random access, variable-size list 
	data structure that allows elements to be added 
	or removed.

Advantages Of ArrayList
-------------------------
* ArrayList is random-access, which means 
	it takes constant time to access any element in the
	array.

* Arraylist or array are defined as contiguous 
	blocks of memory, and so any array element will
	be physically near its neighbors. This greatly
	benifts the modern CPU caching memory.


Disadvantages Of ArrayList
----------------------------
* To create an array we must allocate memory for a 
	certain number of elements and to add more 
	elements to the array we must create a 
	new array and copy the old into the new one. 
	This can take a lot of time.
