Introduction to Recursion
--------------------------

• Any Function which calls itself is called recursion. 

• A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem. This is called the recursion step.

• The recursion step can result in many more such recursive calls. It is important to ensure that the recursion terminates.






• Each time the function calls itself with a slightly simple version of the original problem.

• The sequence of smaller problems must eventually converge on the BASE CASE.
