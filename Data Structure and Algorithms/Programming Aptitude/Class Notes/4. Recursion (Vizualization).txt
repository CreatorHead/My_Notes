Recursion and Memory (Visualization)
------------------------------------
> Each recursive call makes a new copy of that method (actually only the variables) in memory.(push to the stack)

> Once a method ends (that is, returns some data), the copy of that returning method is removed from memory. (popped from the stack)

> The recursive solutions look simple but visualization and tracing takes times. For better understanding, let us consider the following example.
