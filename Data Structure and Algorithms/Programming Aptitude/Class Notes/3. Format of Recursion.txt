Format of a Recursive Function
------------------------------
> A Recursive function performs a task in part by calling itself to perform the subtasks. At some point, the function encounters a subtask that it can perform without calling itself. This case where the function does not recur , is called the BASE CASE and the function which calls itself to perform a subtask, is referred to as the recursive case.
 
For Example:
