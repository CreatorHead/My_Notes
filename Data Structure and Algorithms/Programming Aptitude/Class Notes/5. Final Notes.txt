Recursion
---------
 A recursive approach mirrors the problem that we are trying to solve. 

 A recursive approach makes it simpler to solve a problem, which may not have the most obvious answers.

 But, recursion adds overhead for each recursive call (needs space on the stack frame) 

 Recursion
 ---------
• Terminates when a base case is reached.

• Each recursive call requires extra space on the stack frame (memory).

• If we have a infinite recursion, the program may run out of memory and gives back stack overflow.

• Solutions to some problem are easier to formulate recursively.
