LIST- When sequence matters
	Collection that know about index position.
	List know where something is in the list. You can have more than one element referencing the same object.

SET- When uniqueness matters
	Collections that do not allow duplicates
	Sets know whether something is already in the collection. You can never have more that one element referencing the same object (or more that one element referencing two object).

MAP- Whem finding something by key matters
	Collections that use key-value pairs.
	Maps know the value associated with a given key. You can have two keys that reference the same value, but you cannot have duplicate keys. Although keys are typically String name, a key can be any object.
