Factory Design Pattern:
-----------------------
> Other programs need not to own the responsibility of creating Class Y or Class Z object using new operator instead they get instance of either Class Y or Class Z through the Factory Class.

	1.	As the name implies, Factory Class produces the Objects

	2.	Factory class is a Concrete Class with constructor as private

	3.	getInstance() method should be public static retrun type is of type IterfaceX

	4.	It may or may not take input arguments. It depends on the design.
