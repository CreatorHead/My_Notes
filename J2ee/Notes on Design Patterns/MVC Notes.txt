MVC Design Pattern
------------------
 > This design pattern divides entire request & 
 response flow into three components & 
 it defines the interactions between them
	1.	Model
	2.	View+
	3.	Controller

1.	Model: (Data Model):-
	It’s the core part of the application &
	consists of application business logic 
	In J2EE  application “plain Java Classes” 
	are used as models

2.	View:- 
	The view captures the data from 
	the user & also displays the data to the user
	It does not worry about what that 
	data means, or where to store that data etc.
	In j2ee applications “HTML/ JSP’s” 
	are used as Views.

3.	Controller:-
	Controller controls both model &
	views. In other words it controls 
	the entire request and response flow.
	It takes the request from View, 
	calls the Model to get some data and passes 
	the data to the vies for displaying to user
