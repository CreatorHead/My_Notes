1- Go to current folder:
 cmd: git init	//initialize the folder as git repository

 cmd: git add	//add the file in the staging environment

 cmd: git status	//to see status of the file

 cmd: git add .		//to staging environment

 cmd: git commit -m	'your msg'	// whatever will be on the staging environment
					   will be logged as a record in the commint
					   log. (-m for message)
 
 Note: The difference between staging and comminting is like 
	   Saving a file and printing a file (When you print
	   it becomes more permanent)
	   
 cmd: git log	// to see the logs

 cmd: git checkout fileName		//revert the file changes

 cmd: git checkout . 	//revert all files changes

 cmd: git reset HEAD fileName 	//remove a file from staging 
								environment.

 cmd: git rm -f FileName 	// Delete the file and move every thing
							   in staging (it's quicker) 
							   
 cmd: git add --all 	//do the staging and all handle all the
						  all the file manipulation automatically

 cmd: git diff // it will show you the changes that are made in the files.
 	  git diff --staged //show the file which are staged
